# multi-agent-cooperation-learning
In 2019/2020, OpenAI published a paper called "Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Autocurricula", by Baker et al., which generated a lot of momentum in the multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning field. This is a project based on OpenAI's multi-agent-emergence-environments (the code released by OpenAI after the publication of the paper) and uses OpenAI's framework to build a new environment (MACL) where developers can deploy their own experiments in order to study good ways to foster cooperation intelligence between agents and machines. This work was done during a Semester Project at ETH ZÃ¼rich and I hope it can serve as additional material to support engineers and researchers in using OpenAI's original code to develop their own projects. For more information, a report is attached below under the name "Cooperation Learning in multi-agent systems".
